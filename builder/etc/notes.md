*What is the Builder Pattern?*
**Pattern used to create objects made from a bunch of other objects
***When you want to build an object made up from other objects
***When you want the creation of these parts to be indeendent of the main object
***Hide the creation of the parts from the client so both aren't dependent
***The builder knows the specifics and nobody else does
